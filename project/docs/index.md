#  Trusted Relationship with key based authentication
<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A trusted relationship between Windows and Linux or between Linux systems typically involves setting up secure communication channels using key-based authentication mechanisms like SSH (Secure Shell) or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol).


Windows to Linux:

> One common approach is to use SSH key-based authentication. This involves generating a key pair on the Windows system (public and private key), then transferring the public key to the Linux server. The public key is added to the authorized_keys file in the ~/.ssh directory of the Linux user account you wish to authenticate as.
Windows SSH clients like PuTTY or OpenSSH can be used to initiate connections to the Linux server using the private key for authentication.


Linux to Linux:

> The process is similar when establishing trust between Linux systems. You generate a key pair on the source Linux machine, transfer the public key to the target Linux machine, and add it to the authorized_keys file of the target user account.
Once the public key is added, you can authenticate from the source Linux machine to the target Linux machine using the private key.


In both cases, the key-based authentication mechanism ensures secure communication between the systems without requiring manual password entry each time a connection is made.
