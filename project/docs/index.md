## **What is Trusted relationship** ? 
<br>


###  It is a method that enhances security by eliminating the need for password-based authentication while providing a secure means of communication between the client and server to establish a trusted relationship between your Windows client machine and the Unix server using SSH key pairs.

## **Where trusted relationship can be useful** ?

<br>

### A trusted relationship between a Windows client machine and a Unix server using SSH key pairs is typically used in scenarios where secure, authenticated communication is needed between the two systems. This setup is commonly utilized in various scenarios, such as:

<br>

#### 1. **Remote Administration** : System administrators often need to remotely administer Unix servers from Windows machines. Establishing a trusted relationship via SSH key pairs ensures secure access to the server without the need to enter passwords each time.

<br>


#### 2. **Automated Tasks** : SSH key pairs are frequently used in scripts or automated processes running on Windows machines that need to securely communicate with Unix servers. For example, automated backups, file transfers, or configuration management tasks may require SSH authentication for secure communication.

<br>

#### 3. **Git and Version Control** : Developers working on Windows machines might need to interact with Unix-based version control systems like Git hosted on remote servers. SSH key pairs can be used to securely authenticate and push/pull code changes without compromising security.

<br>



#### 4. **Secure File Transfer** : Secure file transfer protocols like SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) rely on SSH for authentication. Windows clients can securely transfer files to Unix servers using these protocols by establishing a trusted relationship via SSH key pairs.

<br>


#### 5. **Application Deployment** : In software development environments, applications may need to be deployed to Unix servers from Windows development machines. SSH key pairs can facilitate secure deployment processes by providing authenticated access to the server.

<br>


#### In all these scenarios, the SSH key pair consists of a public key stored on the Unix server and a private key stored securely on the Windows client machine. The private key is used for authentication by the client, while the public key is stored in the authorized_keys file on the Unix server to verify the client's identity. This setup ensures secure and authenticated communication between the Windows client and the Unix server.
